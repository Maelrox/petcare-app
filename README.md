2. **Install dependencies**:

   Install all dependencies with `pnpm`:

4. **Build your production site**:

   To build your app for production, run:

   This ensures everything works as expected before deploying.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Your app may need to interact with external services like APIs or databases. Make sure you configure them correctly:

  Example `.env`:
  
  ```env
  API_KEY=your-api-key
